# The question

Politicians often tweet about newspapers, either by directly linking to a story or by re-tweeting a newspaper's tweet of a story. Knowing which newspapers politicians link to gives insight both into (a) what they read and (b) their worldview. For example, Donald Trump is well-known for tweeting stories from Fox News, a right-wing news outlet. 

Among Catalan and Spanish politicians, what is the distribution of newspaper articles?

# The methods

We gathered `r nrow(tl)` tweets from `r length(unique(tl$username))` well-known Catalan and Spanish politicians. We algorithmically identified references to `r length(sort(unique(df$newspaper)))` newspapers, and calculated the percentage of references to each for each politician. 


# Results

## Highlights

- ABC is a favorite of the right, but especially Pablo Casado: Pablo Casado % tweeted about ABC articles in 9% of his tweets, followed by España Ciudadana and Societat Civil Catalana.
- The cross-over between newspapers of preference for the Partido Popular, Ciudadanos and SCC was high: for example, El Confidencial, El Español, El Mundo, E-noticies, OKDiario saw high reference rates from politicians in these groups. 
- The cross-over between newspapers of preference for pro-independence politicians was also high: Ara, CCMA, Vilaweb, and local newspapers saw high reference rates from politicians in these groups.
- El País had the highest overall reference rates (7.48% of all tweets containing any link or tag). 
- Where unionist and independentist groups overlapped, it was generally politicians of ERC, Comuns and Socialists: for example, with high rates of El Diario and Público.


## By politician

The below shows the top 10 newspaper re-tweets for each politician.


```{r}
politics <- sort(unique(df$username))
politics <- politics[!is.na(politics)]
for(i in 1:length(politics)){
  this_politic <- politics[i]
  print(create_plot(usernames = this_politic, n = 10))
}
```

## By newspaper

The below shows the top 10 re-tweeters for each newspaper (relative to each person's overall tweet-load).

```{r}
newspapers <- sort(unique(df$newspaper))
newspapers <- newspapers[!is.na(newspapers)]
for(i in 1:length(newspapers)){
  this_politic <- newspapers[i]
  print(create_plot_newspaper(newspapers = this_politic, n = 10))
}
```
